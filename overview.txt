Project Overview

Marketify is a full-stack e-commerce platform designed to provide a seamless shopping experience with real-time inventory management, secure payments, and a highly responsive user interface. Built using Django for the backend and React for the frontend, the platform integrates modern web technologies to ensure performance, scalability, and maintainability.

Technical Stack

Frontend (React & Vite) ðŸŽ¨

Core: React with Vite for optimized and fast builds.

Styling: TailwindCSS for flexible and responsive design.

State Management: React Query for efficient server state synchronization.

Authentication: JWT authentication with a refresh token mechanism.

Payment Integration: Stripe API for seamless and secure transactions.

Key Features:

âœ… Real-time cart updates for a smooth user experience.âœ… Dynamic category navigation for an intuitive browsing experience.âœ… Responsive product grid ensuring mobile-first usability.âœ… Secure user authentication and profile management.âœ… Advanced search functionality for enhanced product discovery.

Why these choices?

React Query handles server state more efficiently than traditional global state management tools, improving performance and minimizing unnecessary re-renders.

Vite speeds up development with instant Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimized production builds.

TailwindCSS allows for rapid styling without bloating CSS files, making development faster and styles more consistent.

JWT with refresh tokens ensures users remain authenticated without requiring frequent logins, improving security and UX.

Stripe API offers a robust, secure, and widely accepted payment gateway that supports multiple payment methods.

Backend (Django & DRF) ðŸ”§

Framework: Django with Django REST Framework (DRF) for scalable and maintainable API development.

Database: PostgreSQL for reliable data storage and transactional integrity.

Authentication: Custom JWT-based authentication.

Media Storage: Cloudinary integration for optimized media file handling.

Key Features:

âœ… RESTful API architecture for efficient data management.âœ… Custom user profiles enabling personalization and order history tracking.âœ… Order management system for seamless tracking of customer purchases.âœ… Category hierarchy implementation for structured product organization.âœ… Persistent cart storage ensuring users don't lose their selections.

Why these choices?

Django REST Framework simplifies API development with built-in serialization, authentication, and permissions management.

PostgreSQL provides robust support for complex queries, transactions, and indexing.

Cloudinary optimizes media storage and delivery, reducing server load and improving image performance.

JWT Authentication secures API endpoints without requiring session-based authentication.
